IMDB Sentiment Analysis with Fine-Tuned BERT using LoRA
This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates the fine-tuning of a BERT-based model for sentiment analysis on the IMDB dataset. The fine-tuning process leverages Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to make the process more efficient and less resource-intensive.

Overview
Contents
samplecode.ipynb: The main Jupyter notebook containing the code for loading the dataset, fine-tuning the BERT model using LoRA, and evaluating the model's performance.

Key Components
Dataset: The IMDB dataset, which is commonly used for binary sentiment classification (positive or negative reviews).
Model: A pre-trained BERT model is fine-tuned using the LoRA technique to adapt it to the specific task of sentiment analysis.
LoRA: Low-Rank Adaptation is used to make the fine-tuning process more efficient by reducing the number of parameters that need to be trained.
Requirements
To run the code in this repository, you'll need the following libraries:

pip install datasets transformers peft torch evaluate numpy

Install dependencies:
Make sure you have Python installed, and then install the required libraries

Dataset
The notebook uses a preprocessed and truncated version of the IMDB dataset, loaded via the datasets library. The dataset is automatically downloaded and processed when you run the notebook.

Model Fine-Tuning
This project employs BERT, a transformer-based model that excels at understanding the context of words in a sentence. The LoRA technique is utilized to perform parameter-efficient fine-tuning, allowing the model to be adapted to the specific task of sentiment analysis without the need for extensive computational resources.

Results
After fine-tuning, the model's performance is evaluated using standard metrics such as accuracy. The fine-tuned model should perform significantly better on sentiment classification compared to the base BERT model
